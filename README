WHAT IS COBCURSES?

CobCurses is a package for use with the Open-Cobol compiler. This
provides the COBOL programmer the ability to program screens in
Open-Cobol, without SCREENS SECTION support. Since the screen I/O
operations depend on the curses/ncurses library, Open-Cobol must
be installed with that support.

CHANGE LOG:

    Fri Jun 30 00:13:50 2017
        - Now uses correct -std=cobol85 for successful cobol compiles.
        - Suppressed two types of C compile warnings

    Sun Nov  5 16:35:45 2017
        - Fixed src/lib/cobcurses.c so that the variable name 
          restrict, is now renamed restrict_ to avoid compile
          errors.
