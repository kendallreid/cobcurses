E-Design
========

1. What is it?

A. This is an application framework using CobCurses,
for use by Electronic hobbyists.


2. What is its status?

A. This is a work in progress and has just been
started. I had hoped to have more of this sample
application completed before the 0.95 release. But
unfortunately I now have some real work to do, that
will keep me occupied for the moment. Look for
updates in CVS in the future, or in the next
release.

You may be able to borrow some ideas from this
project area.

3. How do I build it?

A. You must have CobCurses 0.95 *INSTALLED* first.
The Makefile provided assumes that this release is
installed. Once that is done, just change to this
directory and:

   i)   make clean (if necessary)
   ii)  make
   iii) ./edesign
