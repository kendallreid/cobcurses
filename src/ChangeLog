ChangeLog:
==========

November, 2012

Released as version 0.96, this is a maintenance release,
which was tested with the newer Open Cobol 1.1 compiler.

A number of identifiers were causing compile errors, due
to their length (exceeding 32 characters). As a result,
the following names were changed:

    COBCURSES-REGISTER-CSV-COLUMN-HEADING
      was changed to
    COBCURSES-REGISTER-CSV-COL-HDG

    COBCURSES-REGISTER-CSV-COLUMN-NO
      was changed to
    COBCURSES-REGISTER-CSV-COL-NO

    NC-SELECT-FIELD-AND-OPTIONS
      was changed to
    NC-SELECT-FIELD-AND-OPTS

    COBCURSES-MSG-STRIP-BLANKS-INTERNAL
      was changed to 
    COBCURSES-MSG-STRIP-BLANKS-INT

    COBCURSES-ERROR-MESSAGE-OVERRIDE
      was changed to
    COBCURSES-ERROR-MSG-OVERRIDE

Also corrected a bug as it pertained to a Linux build, tested under
Ubuntu jaunty. The library routine lib/dynstr.c was responsible for
converting string values to COMP-1 for cobol use, and was failing. The
reason was that while strtof() was configured as "available", but the
function prototype was not defined unless __USE_ISOC99 was defined.
Rather than break functionality on other platforms, the code now uses
strtod() which is reliably defined. Test test012 now passes ok.
